‚ú® Key Features
Skill Tracking

    Add Custom Skills: Add any skill you want to learn, defining a final goal (e.g., 100 hours of coding) and the unit of measurement (hours, pages, etc.).
    Progress Bar: Visually track your progress for each skill.
    Milestones: Break down your larger goals into smaller, manageable milestones that appear on your progress bar to keep you motivated.
    Category Management: Create and manage your own custom categories for skills (e.g., "Programming," "Sports," "Languages") and filter your skills based on them.
    Note-Taking: Add your own notes to each skill to jot down important thoughts and information.

Habit Tracking

    Two Habit Types: The app supports both binary habits (done/not done) and counter habits (e.g., drank 3 glasses of water).
    Weekly Tracking Interface: Monitor your habit compliance over the last five days directly from the home screen.
    Achievement Calendar: Each habit has its own dedicated calendar that displays your historical performance and achievements.
    Category Management: Organize your habits by creating custom categories (e.g., "Health," "Religion," "Self-Development"). Habits on the main screen are neatly separated by category.
    Streak Statistics: The app automatically calculates and displays your current streak and your all-time best streak for binary habits.

Data & Analytics

    Unified Daily Log: A dedicated screen shows all your logged progress (for both skills and habits) for any given day on a calendar.
    Statistics Screen: Displays a pie chart that visualizes the distribution of your efforts across different skills.

Personalization & UX

    Bilingual Support: The entire user interface is available in both English and Arabic.
    Light & Dark Mode: Switch between light and dark themes for your visual comfort.
    Motivational Quotes: Start your session with a random motivational quote displayed on the home screen.
    Advanced Settings: Customize your experience by setting a default unit, toggling the visibility of completed skills, and wiping all data to start fresh.
